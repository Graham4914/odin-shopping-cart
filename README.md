## 🎓 **Project Goals & Learning Reflection**

### **My Approach: The Pyramid of Priorities**

This project was not just about building a store—it was about **understanding the priorities behind an e-commerce storefront**:

**1️⃣ Performance First**

- A slow store **loses customers**. I optimized everything from **API calls, caching, lazy loading, image compression, and script minification** to ensure the fastest possible experience.
- This resulted in a **100% Lighthouse score for Performance, Accessibility & Best Practices**.

**2️⃣ User Experience (UX)**

- A store must be **simple, clear, and intuitive**. Every design choice—**navigation, filtering, cart updates, and UI feedback**—was made with the end user in mind.

**3️⃣ Accessibility & Maintainability**

- Ensuring **keyboard navigation**, **screen reader support**, and **clean, modular code** makes this project usable **for everyone** and **easy to extend in the future**.
