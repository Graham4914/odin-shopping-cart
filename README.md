## üéì **Project Goals & Learning Reflection**

### **My Approach: The Pyramid of Priorities**

This project was not just about building a store‚Äîit was about **understanding the priorities behind an e-commerce storefront**:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance First**

- A slow store **loses customers**. I optimized everything from **API calls, caching, lazy loading, and image compression** to ensure the fastest possible experience.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ User Experience (UX)**

- A store must be **simple, clear, and intuitive**. Every design choice‚Äî**navigation, filtering, cart updates, and UI feedback**‚Äîwas made with the end user in mind.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Accessibility & Maintainability**

- Ensuring **keyboard navigation**, **screen reader support**, and **clean, modular code** makes this project usable **for everyone** and **easy to extend in the future**.

## Special thanks to the Odin Project and its contributors for the learning path.
